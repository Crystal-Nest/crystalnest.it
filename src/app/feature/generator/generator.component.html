<cn-section fragment="mod-skeleton-gen" route="generator" title="Mod Skeleton Generator">
  <span class="eop">This mod generator is designed to significantly accelerate the setup and development of new mods, offering a customizable yet standardized template adaptable to any mod. Built on <a href="https://github.com/jaredlll08/MultiLoader-Template" target="_blank">Jared's Multiloader template</a>, it enhances the original with additional Javadocs, annotations, standards, and the <a href="https://github.com/Crystal-Nest/cobweb" target="_blank">Cobweb</a> dependency, further simplifying development.</span>
  <span>This is the same tool used by us, the Crystal Nest team, to create new mods or port them to new Minecraft versions.</span>
  <span>The default license is <a href="https://github.com/Crystal-Nest/.github/blob/main/LICENSE" target="_blank">CNCLv1</a>, our custom (and suggested) license designed to enable open-source mod development while retaining full rights to monetization</span>
  <span class="eop">There are a couple of other licenses available, but you are free to use any license that better suits your needs.</span>
  <span class="eop">Check the toggle below <strong>only</strong> if you are a Crystal Nest member, otherwise fill in the <strong>Ownership</strong> step.</span>

<cn-section fragment="assumptions" route="generator" title="Assumptions">
  <span>Our template works on the following few assumptions:</span>
  <ul>
    <li>IntelliJ IDEA is the IDE of choice.</li>
    <li>Cobweb is a required dependency.</li>
    <li>The source code is publicly available on GitHub.</li>
  </ul>
  <span>These are motivated by the following reasons:</span>
  <ul>
    <li>IntelliJ IDEA, even the free community edition, is a powerful IDE that speeds up mod development, especially with the <a href="https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/8327-minecraft-development" target="_blank">Minecraft Development plugin</a>.</li>
    <li>Cobweb is a mod API that reduces code duplication by providing abstractions for common tasks like game object registration and configuration handling. Check out its <a href="https://github.com/Crystal-Nest/cobweb/wiki" target="_blank">wiki</a> for a complete feature overview.</li>
    <li>
      Publishing your source code on GitHub is good practice, even with an All Rights Reserved license. It allows you to:
      <ul>
        <li>Receive PRs for new features, bug fixes, or version porting.</li>
        <li>Facilitate compatibility with other mods by other modders.</li>
        <li>Track development with GitHub issues and projects.</li>
        <li>Create a wiki for modder and user information.</li>
        <li>Set up release actions to publish your mod automatically.</li>
        <li>Share your knowledge and help others learn from your solutions.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <span>If you do not satisfy them, we strongly advise you to update your development setup.</span>

<cn-section fragment="setup" route="generator" title="Setup">
  <span>Extract the zip folder and open the contents with IntelliJ IDEA. If not done automatically, load the Gradle project.</span>
  <span class="eop">Follow the instruction on the readme to finish the setup!</span>
