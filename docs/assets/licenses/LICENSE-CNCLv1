                                 LICENSE TERMS

Subject to the terms and conditions of this license, the author grants you a
non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to use, modify, and distribute
the mod as outlined herein.


                                  DEFINITIONS

"Mod" means the entire project this license accompanies, including, but not
limited to, source code, compiled binaries, assets, documentation, and any
other related components.

"Modpack" means a collection of mods, distributed as a single package through
files or modpack launchers.

"Private Use" means modification or use restricted solely to the individual
modifying the mod, without any sharing or distribution.

"Public Distribution" means making the mod or related files available publicly
via repositories, mod-hosting platforms, or other publicly accessible methods.

"Source Code" means original code provided by the author(s), including, but not
limited to, code, scripts, configurations, or any text intended for compilation
or interpretation, and includes functionally equivalent code.

"Compiled Binary" means any packaged executable files (e.g., JAR files)
generated from source code.

"Official Distribution Platform (ODP)" means websites or platforms explicitly
authorized by the author for distributing the mod. Common examples include
platforms such as CurseForge and Modrinth; however, the specific authorized
platforms are exclusively determined by the author and may change at the
author's discretion.


                                 ALLOWED USES

1. Inclusion in Modpacks:
   The mod may be referenced as an external dependency within modpacks but must
   not be directly packaged.
   Users or launchers must download the mod exclusively from an ODP.
   Including a reference link in your project's documentation is appreciated
   but not mandatory.

2. API, Addon, and Compatibility Development:
   Developers may freely create addons, compatibility integrations, or
   otherwise utilize the provided API.
   Integration must be via external referencing without embedding the mod's
   source code or compiled binaries.
   Including a reference link in your project's documentation is appreciated
   but not mandatory.

3. Personal Modifications:
   Users may modify the mod. Compiled binaries from such modifications must
   remain private and not be publicly distributed.

4. Forking:
   Public forks are permitted for development or collaborative purposes;
   however, distributing compiled binaries from these forks is prohibited.

5. Server Usage:
   Use of the mod on private and public servers, including servers requiring
   paid access, is permitted provided the mod remains server-side only or
   clients obtain it through an allowed method.
   Including a reference link in your project's documentation is appreciated
   but not mandatory.

6. Videos and Reviews:
   Creation of videos or reviews featuring this mod is always permitted
   provided the mod is obtained through an allowed method and the video or
   review includes a link to an official distribution platform.

7. Official Distribution Platforms:
   All references must link exclusively to the author's designated ODPs.
   Direct bundling or inclusion of mod files within other projects is forbidden.

8. Explicit Permissions:
   Explicit permissions from the mod author override other license restrictions.

                              
                                RESTRICTED USES

1. Reselling:
   Commercial sale or redistribution of the mod is prohibited.

2. Packaging:
   Facilitating or providing mod downloads outside official platforms,
   bypassing official distribution channels, is prohibited.

3. Redistribution:
   Public re-uploading or redistribution of the mod's source code or compiled
   binaries is forbidden.

4. Private Modifications:
   Public sharing or redistribution of privately modified versions is forbidden.

5. Redistribution and Forking:
   Unauthorized distribution of compiled binaries or source code is prohibited.
   Public forks may only be used for development or collaboration; compiled
   distribution is not permitted.
